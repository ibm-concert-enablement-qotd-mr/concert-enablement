Anne Spencer Morrow Lindbergh (June 22, 1906 â€“ February 7, 2001) was an American author and aviator. She was the wife of decorated pioneer aviator Charles Lindbergh, with whom she made many exploratory flights.
Following the kidnap and murder of their eldest child, they lived in Europe, where Charles was impressed by Germany's new air power. When they returned to America, he led the isolationist America First Committee. Anne's supporting booklet The Wave of the Future declared that fascism was the inevitable way forward; she had also written a letter praising Hitler in unequivocal terms.
After the war, she moved away from politics, writing extensive poetry and nonfiction, Gift from the Sea being an inspirational book for women that appears to foreshadow the green movement.
