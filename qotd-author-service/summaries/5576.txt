Alvin "Al" Goldstein (January 10, 1936 – December 19, 2013) was a Jewish American pornographer. He is known for helping normalize hardcore pornography in the United States.He was described in his obituary in The New York Times as "a cartoonishly vituperative amalgam of Borscht Belt comic, free-range social critic and sex-obsessed loser who seemed to embody a moment in New York City's cultural history: the sleaze and decay of Times Square in the 1960s and ‘70s."
