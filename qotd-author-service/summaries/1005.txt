Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa (Bengali: শ্রীরামকৃষ্ণ পরমহংস, romanized: Ramokṛṣṇo Pôromhongśo ; 17 Feb 1836 – 16 August 1886), born Gadadhar Chattopadhyaya, (Bengali: গদাধর চট্টোপাধ্যায় ) was an Indian Hindu mystic, saint, and religious leader in 19th century Bengal. Sri Ramakrishna experienced spiritual ecstasies from a young age, and was influenced by several religious traditions, including devotion toward the Goddess Kali, Tantra, Bhakti and Advaita Vedanta.As a priest at the Dakshineshwar Kali Temple, his mystical temperament and ecstasies gradually gained him widespread acknowledgement, attracting to him various spiritual teachers, social leaders, and lay followers; he eventually taught disciples, who would later form the monastic Ramakrishna Order. He was generally revered by Bengali elites and within religious circles, which led his chief disciple Swami Vivekananda to found the Ramakrishna Math, which provides spiritual training for monastics and householder devotees and the Ramakrishna Mission to provide charity, social work and education.
