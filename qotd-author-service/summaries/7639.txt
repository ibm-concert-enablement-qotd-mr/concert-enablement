He has written two books: a memoir titled Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites (2003) and a political book titled Ship of Fools (2018).
An advocate of former U.S. president Donald Trump, Carlson has been described by Politico as "perhaps the highest-profile proponent of 'Trumpism' and willing to criticize Trump if he strayed from it". He is also said to have influenced some key policy decisions by Trump. As of 2021, Tucker Carlson Tonight is the second-most-watched cable news show in the United States. Carlson's controversial statements on race, immigration and women have led to advertiser boycotts against the show.A vocal opponent of progressivism, Carlson has been called a nationalist and a paleoconservative. He is a critic of immigration. Originally a supporter of libertarian economic policy, Carlson later criticized the ideology as being "controlled by the banks" and became a protectionist. He has been skeptical of foreign interventions by the U.S., and renounced his initial support of the Iraq War.
