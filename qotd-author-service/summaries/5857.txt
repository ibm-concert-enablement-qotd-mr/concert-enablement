Mary Gladys Webb (25 March 1881 â€“ 8 October 1927) was an English romantic novelist and poet of the early 20th century, whose work is set chiefly in the Shropshire countryside and among Shropshire characters and people whom she knew. Her novels have been successfully dramatized, most notably the film Gone to Earth in 1950 by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.  The novels are thought to have inspired the famous parody Cold Comfort Farm (1932) by Stella Gibbons.
