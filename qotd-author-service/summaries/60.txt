Doug Larson (February 10, 1926 – April 1, 2017) was a columnist and editor for the Door County Advocate (1953–1964) and wrote a daily column, "Doug’s Dugout," for the Green Bay Press-Gazette (1964–1988), both Wisconsin-based newspapers. The column was originally syndicated through United Media under the title "Senator Soaper Says"; Larson took over authorship in 1980. Previously, it had been written by Bill Vaughn of the Kansas City Star. Larson was born in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin.
