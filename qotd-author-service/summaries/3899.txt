Eliot Laurence Spitzer (born June 10, 1959) is an American politician, attorney, educator, and real estate developer. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 54th Governor of New York from 2007 until his resignation in 2008.
Born in New York City, Spitzer attended Princeton University and earned his law degree from Harvard. He began his career as a attorney in private practice with New York law firms and as a prosecutor with the office of the New York County (Manhattan) District Attorney. From 1999 to 2006, he served two four-year terms as the Attorney General of New York, earning a reputation as the "Sheriff of Wall Street" for his efforts to curb corruption in the financial services industry. Spitzer was elected Governor of New York in 2006 New York gubernatorial election by the largest margin of any candidate, but his tenure would last less than two years after it was uncovered that he patronized a prostitution ring. He resigned immediately following the scandal, with the remainder of his term served by David Paterson, his lieutenant governor. 
Since leaving the governorship, Spitzer has worked as a television host and an adjunct instructor at City College of New York, along with engaging in real estate activity and making private investments in a start-up company. He also ran for New York City Comptroller in 2013, losing the Democratic nomination to the eventual winner, Scott Stringer.
