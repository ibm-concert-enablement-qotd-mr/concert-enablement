Prior to his work in journalism, Krohn wrote and self-published the book Defining Conservatism, in which he sought to outline core conservative principles. He gained national attention when he addressed the 2009 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), at age 13. Krohn convinced skeptical organizers to allow him to speak for three minutes at the CPAC event on February 27, 2009. His speech was well-received by the audience and later gained popularity on the internet, garnering Krohn's attention on national news programs on CNN and the Fox News Channel. In 2009, he was a finalist for Time magazine's Time 100 for the year. His second book, Defining Conservatism: The Principles That Will Bring Our Country Back, was released on February 9, 2010.In 2011, Krohn openly declared he no longer held conservative views, a change he attributed to his study of philosophers and maturing with age.
