Timothy Francis Murphy (born September 11, 1952) is an American psychologist, author, and former politician. A Republican, he served as the U.S. representative for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district from 2003 until his resignation in 2017. He is a former member of the Pennsylvania State Senate, representing the 37th Senate district, and a commander in the United States Navy Reserve. The 18th district included several suburbs south of Pittsburgh. It was later redrawn by order of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and became the 14th Congressional District, which includes portions of Westmoreland and southern Allegheny County as well as Fayette, Greene and Washington counties. Murphy consistently carried his district with at least 58% of the vote, including unopposed re-election bids in 2014 and 2016.
In October 2017, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that Murphy, who had engaged in an extramarital affair, urged his mistress to have an abortion despite his strict public anti-abortion stance. House Speaker Paul Ryan announced that Murphy had tendered his resignation effective October 21, 2017. Subsequent reporting described endemic abuse and harassment in Murphy's congressional office.
