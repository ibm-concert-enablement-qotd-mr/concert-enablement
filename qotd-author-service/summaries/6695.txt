Theodore Chaikin Sorensen (May 8, 1928 â€“ October 31, 2010) was an American lawyer, writer, and presidential adviser. He was a speechwriter for President John F. Kennedy, as well as one of his closest advisers. President Kennedy once called him his "intellectual blood bank". Most notably, he was generally regarded as the author of Profiles in Courage even before fully admitting it in his 2008 memoir. The book won Kennedy the Pulitzer Prize for biography in 1957. Sorensen was also the primary author of Kennedy's 1962 "We choose to go to the Moon" speech.
